This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. In this classic game, players must guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

2. The game will randomly select a word from its list of words.
3. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters.
4. Type a letter and hit enter.
5. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, you lose an attempt.
